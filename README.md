# Restaurant Booking Homepage

This project contains a simple, single-page HTML template for a restaurant booking homepage. It's designed to showcase the restaurant's atmosphere through a full-background image and provides a user-friendly interface for online booking, including login and sign-up options.

## Features

- **Full-Page Background Image**: A captivating full-page background image that represents the restaurant's ambiance.
- **Responsive Design**: Basic styling included for displaying on various devices (though for a real-world application, further responsive adjustments may be necessary).
- **Login and Sign-Up Buttons**: Easy navigation for users to log in or sign up to book a table.
- **Simple Login Form**: A straightforward form for users to enter their login credentials.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser.
- A text editor to modify the HTML and CSS according to your needs.

### How to Use

1. **Customize the Template**: Replace `'your-image-url.jpg'` in the CSS `.bg-image` class with the URL of your restaurant's image to customize the background.
2. **Edit Content**: Modify the text in the `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<footer>` tags to reflect your restaurant's information and contact details.
3. **Connect to Backend (Optional)**: To make the login and sign-up functionality work, you will need to connect the form to your backend server. This template does not include backend functionality.

## Deployment

This template is ready to be published on any static hosting service. Simply upload the `index.html` file to your server. For dynamic functionality (like form submission), ensure your server supports the necessary backend technologies.
